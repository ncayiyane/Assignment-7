# Assignment 7: GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board for the AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System, continuing from the requirements (Assignment 4), use cases (Assignment 5), and Agile planning (Assignment 6).

## Repository Structure

- [template_analysis.md](./template_analysis.md): Comparison table of GitHub project templates and justification for the selected template.
- [kanban_explanation.md](./kanban_explanation.md): Definition and purpose of Kanban boards in the context of our project.
- [reflection.md](./reflection.md): Reflection on challenges encountered in selecting and customizing the template.
- [screenshots](./screenshots/): Directory containing screenshots of template comparison and custom Kanban board.

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System allows patients to schedule medical appointments online and enables healthcare providers to manage their availability efficiently. This repository focuses on implementing project management tools using GitHub's project templates and Kanban boards to facilitate Agile development workflows.

## Kanban Board

A GitHub Project has been created using the selected template and customized with additional columns to better suit our development workflow. The board contains tasks from our previous sprint plan (Assignment 6) and demonstrates how we track progress using the Kanban methodology.

### Customization Choices

Our Kanban board has been customized with the following additional columns beyond the default "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done":

1. **Testing Column**: Added to create a dedicated space for tasks that have been implemented but require quality assurance before being considered complete. This aligns with our development process where code must pass testing before deployment.

2. **Blocked Column**: Implemented to clearly identify tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies or obstacles. This helps the team quickly identify bottlenecks and prioritize their resolution.

We've also set Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits:
- **In Progress**: Limited to 5 tasks to prevent team members from context-switching too frequently
- **Testing**: Limited to 3 tasks to ensure our QA process doesn't become a bottleneck

These customizations support our Agile workflow by:
- Providing clear visibility into the status of all tasks
- Identifying bottlenecks early through the Blocked column
- Maintaining a steady flow of work through WIP limits
- Ensuring quality through a dedicated testing phase

## Assignment Requirements Fulfilled

1. **Template Analysis and Selection**: Explored and compared GitHub's project templates, selecting the most suitable one for our system.
2. **Custom Kanban Board Creation**: Created and customized a Kanban board with additional columns and populated it with tasks from our sprint plan.
3. **Kanban Board Explanation**: Provided a detailed explanation of Kanban boards and how our implementation supports Agile principles.
4. **Reflection**: Discussed challenges in selecting and customizing the template and compared GitHub's templates to other tools.
