## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System allows patients to schedule medical appointments online and enables healthcare providers to manage their availability efficiently. This repository focuses on implementing project management tools using GitHub's project templates and Kanban boards to facilitate Agile development workflows.

## Kanban Board

A GitHub Project has been created using the selected template and customized with additional columns to better suit our development workflow. The board contains tasks from our previous sprint plan (Assignment 6) and demonstrates how we track progress using the Kanban methodology.
